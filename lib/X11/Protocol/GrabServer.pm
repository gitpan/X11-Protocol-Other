=head1 NAME

X11::Protocol::GrabServer -- object-oriented server grabbing

=for test_synopsis my ($X)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use X11::Protocol::GrabServer;
 {
   my $grab = X11::Protocol::GrabServer->new ($X); 
   do_some_things();
   # UngrabServer when $grab destroyed
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object-oriented approach to GrabServer / UngrabServer on an
C<X11::Protocol> connection.  A grab object represents a desired server grab
and destroying it ungrabs.

The first grab object on a connection does a C<GrabServer()> and the last
destroyed does an C<UngrabServer()>.  The idea is that it's easier to manage
the lifespan of a grabbing object in a block etc than to be sure of catching
all exits.

Multiple grab objects can overlap or nest.  A single C<GrabServer()> is done
and it remains until the last object is destroyed.  This is good in a
library or sub-function where an C<UngrabServer()> should wait until the end
of any outer desired grab.

A server grab is usually to make a few operations atomic, for instance
something global like root window properties.  A block-based temporary per
the synopsis above is typical.  It's also possible to hold a grab object for
an extended time, perhaps for some state driven interaction.

Care must be taken not to grab for too long since other client programs are
locked out.  If a grabbing program hangs then the server will be unusable
until the program is killed, or its TCP etc server connection is broken.

=head2 Weak C<$X>

If Perl weak references are available (Perl 5.6 and up and C<Scalar::Util>
with its usual XS code), then a grab object holds only a weak reference to
the target C<$X> connection.  This means the grab doesn't keep the
connection up once nothing else is interested.  When a connection is
destroyed the server ungrabs automatically so there's no need for an
explicit C<UngrabServer()> in that case.

The main effect of the weakening is that C<$X> can be garbage collected
anywhere within a grabbing block, the same as if there was no grab.  Without
the weakening it would wait until the end of the block.  In practice this
only rarely makes a difference.

In the future if an C<X11::Protocol> connection gets a notion of an explicit
close then the intention would be to skip any C<UngrabServer()> in that case
too, ie. treat a closed connection the same as a weakened away connection.

Currently no attention is paid to whether the server has disconnected the
link.  A C<UngrabServer()> is done on destroy in the usual way.  If the
server has disconnected then a C<SIGPIPE> or C<EPIPE> occurs the same as for
any other request sent to the C<$X>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<$g = X11::Protocol::GrabServer-E<gt>new ($X)>

C<$X> is an C<X11::Protocol> object.  Create and return a C<$g> object
representing a grab of the C<$X> server.

If this new C<$g> is the first new grab on C<$X> then an
C<$X-E<gt>GrabServer> is done.

=item C<$g-E<gt>ungrab ()>

Ungrab the C<$g> object.  An ungrab is done automatically when C<$g>
is destroyed, but C<$g-E<gt>ungrab()> can do it sooner.

If C<$g> is already ungrabbed this way then do nothing.

=item C<$g-E<gt>grab ()>

Re-grab with the C<$g> object.  This can be used after a C<$g-E<gt>ungrab()>
to grab again using the same object, the same as if newly created.

If C<$g> is already grabbing, then do nothing.

=item C<$bool = $g-E<gt>is_grabbed ()>

Return true if C<$g> is grabbing.  This is true when first created, or false
after a C<$g-E<gt>ungrab()>.
