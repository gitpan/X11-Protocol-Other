=head1 NAME

X11::Protocol::Ext::XTEST - synthetic user input and more

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use X11::Protocol;
 my $X = X11::Protocol->new;
 $X->init_extension('XTEST')
   or print "XTEST extension not available";

 $X->XTestFakeInput (name   => 'ButtonPress',
                     detail => 3);  # physical button 3
 $X->XTestFakeInput (name   => 'ButtonRelease',
                     detail => 3);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The XTEST extension provides

=over

=item *

Synthetic keyboard and mouse pointer actions.

=item *

Displayed cursor comparisons.

=item *

Test programs continuing during C<GrabServer> by other clients.

=back

These things help exercise library or server features which would otherwise
require user interaction.

=head1 REQUESTS

The following requests are made available with an C<init_extension()>, as
per L<X11::Protocol/EXTENSIONS>.

    my $is_available = $X->init_extension('XTEST');

=over

=item C<($server_major, $server_minor) = $X-E<gt>XTestGetVersion ($client_major, $client_minor)>

Negotiate a protocol version with the server.  C<$client_major> and
C<$client_minor> is what the client would like.  The returned
C<$server_major> and C<$server_minor> is what the server will do.

The current code supports up to 2.1.  The intention would be to
automatically negotiate in C<init_extension()> if/when necessary.

=back

=head2 Cursor Comparisons

=over

=item C<$is_same = $X-E<gt>XTestCompareCursor ($window, $cursor)>

Return true if the cursor attribute of C<$window> is equal to C<$cursor>.
C<$cursor> can be

=over

=item *

XID (an integer) of a cursor.

=item *

"None" (or 0).

=item *

"CurrentCursor" (or 1) for the currently displayed cursor.

=back

This can be used to check that the cursor attribute of some C<$window> is a
desired setting, for example

    $desired_cursor = $X->new_rsrc;
    $X->CreateGlyphCursor ($desired_cursor, ...);

    $X->XTestCompareCursor ($window, $desired_cursor)
      or die "Oops, $window doesn't have desired cursor";

Or alternatively, construct a window with a particular cursor and use
"CurrentCursor" to check that what's currently displayed is as desired, for
example to see if a C<GrabPointer()> is displaying what's intended,

    my $test_window = $X->new_rsrc;
    $X->CreateWindow ($test_window, ...,
                      cursor => $desired_cursor);

    $X->XTestCompareCursor ($test_window, "CurrentCursor");
      or die "Oops, currently displayed cursor is not as desired";

=back

=head2 Simulated Input

=over

=item C<$X-E<gt>XTestFakeInput (name=E<gt>...)>

=item C<$X-E<gt>XTestFakeInput ([ name=E<gt>... ])>

=item C<$X-E<gt>XTestFakeInput ([ name=E<gt>], [name=E<gt>], ...)>

Simulate user input for button presses, key presses, and pointer movement.

An input action is specified as an event packet using fields similar to
C<$X-E<gt>pack_event()>.

C<XTestFakeInput()> is always a single user action, so for example a button
press and button release are two separate C<XTestFakeInput()> requests.  For
the core events a single event packet is enough to describe an input but
some extensions such as C<XInputExtension> may require more.

=over

=item Button Press and Release

The argument fields are

    name       "ButtonPress" or "ButtonRelease"
    detail     physical button number (1 upwards)
    time       milliseconds delay before event, default 0

For example to fake a physical button 3 press

    $X->XTestFakeInput (name   => 'ButtonPress',
                        detail => 3);

C<detail> is the physical button number, before the core protocol
C<SetPointerMapping()> translation is applied.  To simulate a logical button
it's necessary to check C<GetPointerMapping()> to see which physical button,
if any, corresponds.

Be careful when faking a C<ButtonPress> as it might be important to fake a
matching C<ButtonRelease> too.  On the X.org server circa 1.9.x after a
synthetic press the physical mouse doesn't work to generate a release and
the button is left hung (presumably in its normal implicit pointer grab).

=item Key Press and Release

The argument fields are

    name       "KeyPress" or "KeyRelease"
    detail     keycode (integer)
    time       milliseconds delay before event, default 0

=item Mouse Pointer Movement

Mouse pointer motion can be induced with the following.  The effect is
similar to a C<WarpPointer()>.

    name       "MotionNotify"
    root       XID of root window, default "None" for current
    root_x     \ pointer position to move to
    root_y     /
    detail     flag 0=absolute, 1=relative, default 0
    time       milliseconds delay before event, default 0

C<root> is the root window (integer XID) to move on.  The default "None" (or
0) means the screen the pointer is currently on.

    $X->XTestFakeInput (name   => 'MotionNotify',
                        root_x => 123,
                        root_y => 456);

C<detail> can be 1 to move relative to the current mouse position.

    $X->XTestFakeInput (name   => 'MotionNotify',
                        root_x => 10,
                        root_y => -20,
                        detail => 1); # relative motion

=item Other Events

Extension events can be faked after an C<init_extension()> so they're
recognised by C<$X-E<gt>pack_event()>.  It's up to the server or extension
which events can actually be simulated.

If an extension input requires more than one event packet to describe then
pass multiple arrayrefs.  For example C<DeviceMotion> (from
C<XInputExtension>) may need further C<DeviceValuator> packets,

    $X->XTestFakeInput ([ name => 'DeviceMotion', ... ],
                        [ name => 'DeviceValuator', ... ],
                        [ name => 'DeviceValuator',  ... ]);  

=back

For all events C<time> is how long in milliseconds the server should wait
before playing the event.  The default is 0 for no delay.  No further
requests are processed from the current client during the delay, so a
sequence of C<XTestFakeInput()> with delays will execute sequentially with
one delay after another.

Generally the event fields from a C<$X-E<gt>{'event_handler'}> function
cannot be passed directly to C<XTestFakeInput()> to replay it.  In
particular,

=over

=item *

C<time> from an event is a timestamp, so would have to be zeroed or adjusted
to a relative time for a delay in C<XTestFakeInput()>.

=item *

For C<MotionNotify>, C<detail> from an event is the hint mechanism, so would
have to be zeroed for the absolute/relative flag in C<XTestFakeInput()>.

=item *

For C<ButtonPress> and C<ButtonRelease>, C<detail> from an event is a
logical button number after C<SetPointerMapping()> transformation, whereas
C<XFakeInput()> takes a physical number.  A reverse lookup through the
C<GetPointerMapping()> table would be needed.

=back

=back

=head2 GrabServer Imperviousness

=over

=item C<$X-E<gt>XTestGrabControl ($impervious)>

Control the current client's behaviour during a C<GrabServer()> by another
client.

If C<$impervious> is 1 then the current client can continue to make
requests, ie. it's impervious to server grabs by other clients.

If C<$impervious> is 0 then the current client behaves as normal.  Its
requests wait during any C<GrabServer()> by another client.

=back
