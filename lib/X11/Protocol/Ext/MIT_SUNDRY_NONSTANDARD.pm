=head1 NAME

X11::Protocol::Ext::MIT_SUNDRY_NONSTANDARD - X11R2/R3 compatibility mode

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use X11::Protocol;
 my $X = X11::Protocol->new;
 $X->init_extension('MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD')
   or print "MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD extension not available";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD extension controls a "bug mode" setting in the
server which helps some X11R2 and X11R3 client programs, including C<xterm>
from those releases.

Bug mode means: relaxing event mask checking in grab pointer and button
requests and window do-not-propagate attributes (to ignore mask bits which
are not applicable); something for non-overlapping sibling window stacking
order; and keeping maximum keycode below 255 to avoid an Xt toolkit
segfault.  Unless working with old client programs then these things are
unlikely to be of interest.

=head1 REQUESTS

The following are made available with an C<init_extension()> per
L<X11::Protocol/EXTENSIONS>.

    my $bool = $X->init_extension('MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD');

=over

=item C<$X-E<gt>MitSundryNonstandardSetBugMode ($flag)>

=item C<$flag = $X-E<gt>MitSundryNonstandardGetBugMode ()>

Get or set the bug mode flag.  1 means compatibility mode is on, 0 means
off.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<X11::Protocol>

L<xset(1)> "bc" option to control the bug flag from the command line.

L<Xserver(1)> "bc" command-line option to set the flag at server startup.
