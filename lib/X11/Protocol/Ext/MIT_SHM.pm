=head1 DESCRIPTION

The MIT-SHM extension allows a client and server running on the same machine
to transfer image data through System-V shared memory segments.

The client creates a memory segment with C<shmget()> (see L<perlfunc/shmget>
and L<perlipc/"SysV IPC">) and asks the server to attach to it and then read
or write with equivalents to the core GetImage and PutImage.

The aim is to avoid sending large images through the I/O connection when on
the same machine.  Memory is faster, and may help avoid request size limits
for very big images.

Byte order, padding, etc, required or generated in images is specified by
the server C<$X-E<gt>{'image_byte_order'}>, C<$X-E<gt>{'pixmap_formats'}>,
etc, the same as for the core C<GetImage()> and C<PutImage()>.  It's up to
the client to adapt to the server's layout, which can be a bit of a chore.

=head2 Shm from Perl

A shared memory segment can be created from Perl with C<shmget()>, then read
or write its contents with C<shmread()> and C<shmwrite()>.  Those functions
attach and detach it each time with C<shmat()> and C<shmdt()> system calls,
which is fine for grabbing the lot, but will be a bit slow for lots of
little accesses.

C<IPC::SysV> (version 2 up) offers a C<shmat()> to keep the block attached
and C<memread()> and C<memwrite()> to access it (see L<IPC::SysV>).  See
L<IPC::SharedMem> for an object-oriented wrapper around this too.

Incidentally, if C<shmget()> is not available on the system then Perl's
C<shmget()> croaks.  It's always possible for it to return C<undef> too for
not enough memory etc.  With that, not being on the same machine, not having
identifiable perms, etc, there's a quite a few cases where a fallback to
plain I/O will be necessary.

=head2 Shm Permissions

A SysV shared memory segment has owner/group/other permission bits similar
to a file.  The server will only attach to segments which the requesting
client UID/GID has permission to read or write.

The server can usually determine a client's UID/GID on a local connection
such as Unix socket (L<X11::Protocol::Connection::UNIXSocket>, and
C<SO_PEERCRED> in L<socket(7)>), and perhaps on a TCP localhost loopback.
Failing that the server treats the client as "other" and will only attach to
world-readable (or world read-writable) segments.

You can make a shm segment world-readable to ensure the server can read it.
If the data for a PutImage etc is already from a world-readable file or is
public then it doesn't matter who else reads the segment.  Remember to ask
for read-only in the C<MitShmAttach()> so the server doesn't want writable
too.

There's probably no need to risk relaxing permissions for writing.  Chances
are that if client UID/GID can't be identified then it's because the
connection is not local and the server is on a different machine so shared
memory can't be used anyway.

It's usual for the server to run as root, hence it's own permission checks,
but it's also possible for the server to be an ordinary user.  In that case
the shm segments it can access will be limited in the usual way for the user
it's running as.

=head1 REQUESTS

The following requests are available after an C<init_extension()> per
L<X11::Protocol/EXTENSIONS>.

    my $bool = $X->init_extension('MIT-SHM');

In the following C<$shmid> is the shared memory ID (an integer) as obtained
from the kernel with C<shmget()>.  C<$shmseg> is an XID (allocated as usual
by client C<$X-E<gt>new_rsrc()>) on the server representing the server
attachment to the block.

=over

=item C<($server_major, $server_minor, $uid, $gid, $shared_pixmaps, $pixmap_format) = $X-E<gt>MitShmQueryVersion ()>

Return information about the MIT-SHM extension.  Unlike other extensions
there's no client version / server version negotiation.

C<$server_major> and C<$server_minor> are the extension version number
implemented by the server.

C<$uid> and C<$gid> (integers) are the server's effective user ID and group
ID (C<geteuid()> and C<getegid()>).  Zero means root.

C<$shared_pixmaps> is non-zero if pixmaps in shared memory are supported
(see C<MitShmCreatePixmap()> below).  C<$pixmap_format> (an ImageFormat) is
"XYPixmap" or "ZPixmap" for the layout required in such a pixmap.

=item C<$X-E<gt>MitShmAttach ($shmseg, $shmid, $readonly)>

Attach the server to a given shared memory segment.  C<$shmseg> is a new XID
to represent the attached memory.

    my $shmseg = $X->new_rsrc;
    $X->MitShmAttach ($shmseg, $shmid, 0); # read/write

C<$shmid> is the shared memory ID to attach, as obtained from C<shmget()>
(see L<perlfunc/shmget>).

C<$readonly> is 1 to have the server attach read-only, or 0 for read-write.
Read-only suffices for C<MitShmPutImage()>, but read-write is needed for
C<MitShmGetImage()> and C<MitShmCreatePixmap()>.

=item C<$X-E<gt>MitShmDetach ($shmseg)>

Detach the server from shared memory C<$shmseg> (an XID) and release that
XID.

    $X->MitShmDetach ($shmseg);

=item C<$X-E<gt>MitShmPutImage ($drawable, $gc, $depth, $total_width, $total_height, $src_x, $src_y, $src_width, $src_height, $dst_x, $dst_y, $format, $send_event, $shmseg, $offset)>

Put image data from C<$shmseg> (an XID) to C<$drawable>.  The parameters are
similar to the core C<PutImage()>.

C<$depth> is the depth of the image.  For C<$format> "Bitmap" this must be 1
and the foreground and background colours of C<$gc> are then drawn.  For
C<$format> "XYPixmap" and "ZPixmap" C<$depth> must be the depth of
C<$drawable>.

C<$total_width>,C<$total_height> is the full size of the image in the shared
memory.  C<$src_x>,C<$src_y> and C<$src_width>,C<$src_height> are the
portion of it to draw.  C<$dst_x>,C<$dst_y> is where in C<$drawable> to put
it.

C<$format> is "Bitmap", "XYPixmap" or "ZPixmap" (an ImageFormat).

C<$send_event> is 1 to have an C<MitShmCompletionEvent> sent to the client
when drawing is finished (see L</"EVENTS"> below), or 0 if that's not
wanted.

C<$offset> is a byte offset into the shared memory where the image starts.

=item C<($depth, $visual, $size) = $X-E<gt>MitShmGetImage ($drawable, $x, $y, $width, $height, $planemask, $format, $shmseg, $offset)>

Copy an image from C<$drawable> to shared memory C<$shmseg> (an XID).  The
parameters are similar to the core C<GetImage()>.

C<$x>,C<$y>, C<$width>,C<$height> are the part of C<$drawable> to get.
C<$planemask> is a bit mask for which bit planes of the pixels are wanted.

C<$format> is "XYPixmap" or "ZPixmap" for the layout to be written to the
shared memory, and C<$offset> is a byte offset into the memory where the
image should start.

The returned C<$depth> (an integer) is the depth of C<$drawable>.
C<$visual> (integer ID) is its visual for a window, or "None" for a pixmap.
C<$size> is how many bytes were written.

C<$shmseg> must be attached read-write in the C<MitShmAttach()> or an
C<Access> error results.

=item C<$X-E<gt>MitShmCreatePixmap ($pixmap, $drawable, $depth, $width, $height, $shmseg, $offset)>

Create C<$pixmap> (a new XID) as a pixmap with contents in shared memory
C<$shmseg> (an XID).  When the client reads or writes that memory it changes
the pixmap contents.  The parameters are similar to the core
C<CreatePixmap()>.

    my $pixmap = $X->new_rsrc;
    $X->MitShmCreatePixmap ($pixmap,         # new XID
                            $X->root,        # for the screen
                            $X->root_depth,  # depth
                            10,10,           # width,height
                            $shmseg,
                            0);      # byte offset into shm

The C<MitShmQueryVersion()> request above reports whether shared memory
pixmaps are supported, and if so whether they're "XYPixmap" or "ZPixmap"
layout.

C<$drawable> is used to determine the screen for the new C<$pixmap>.
C<$offset> is a byte offset into the shared memory where the pixmap data
will begin.

If damage objects from the DAMAGE extension (see
L<X11::Protocol::Ext::DAMAGE>) are monitoring a shared C<$pixmap> then
client writes to the shared memory generally don't produce C<DamageNotify>
events.  The client can use C<DamageAdd()> requests (in Damage version 1.1)
to tell the server about changes made, which it will broadcast to interested
damage objects.  It's probably unusual to have damage objects listening to a
shared pixmap though.

=back

=head1 EVENTS

C<MitShmCompletionEvent> is sent to the client when requested in an
C<MitShmPutImage()>.  It says the server has finished reading the memory.
The event has the usual fields

    name             "MitShmCompletionEvent"
    synthetic        true if from a SendEvent
    code             integer opcode
    sequence_number  integer

and event-specific fields

    drawable       XID, target as from request
    shmseg         XID, source as from request
    offset         integer, byte offset as from request
    major_opcode   integer, MIT-SHM extension code
    minor_opcode   integer, 3 for MitShmPutImage

C<major_opcode> and C<minor_opcode> are the codes of the originating
C<MitShmPutImage()>.  These fields are similar to the core
C<GraphicsExposure> and C<NoExposure> events, but here there's only one
request (C<MitShmPutImage()>) which gives a completion event.

=head1 ERRORS

Error type "ShmSeg" is a bad C<$shmseg> resource XID in a request.

# =head2 Multi-CPU Synchronization
# 
# Some older multi-CPU or multi-core systems had bizarre rules for explicit
# synchronization when sharing memory between different CPUs or cores.  Not
# certain if a shm client must do anything special.  Presumably the C<shmdt>
# system call in Perl's C<shmread>/C<shmwrite> would take care of any cache
# sync demanded in that case at least.
