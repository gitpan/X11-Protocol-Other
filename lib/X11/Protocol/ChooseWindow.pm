=head1 NAME

X11::Protocol::ChooseWindow -- user click to choose window

=for test_synopsis my ($X)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use X11::Protocol::ChooseWindow;
 my $client_window = X11::Protocol::ChooseWindow->choose (X => $X);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This spot of code lets the user click on a toplevel window to choose it, in
a similar style to the C<xwininfo> or C<xkill> programs.

=head2 Implementation

The method is similar to the C<xwininfo> etc programs.  It consists of a
C<GrabPointer> on the root window, waits for a C<ButtonPress> and
corresponding C<ButtonRelease> from the user, get the frame window is from
the Press event, then the client window under there from
C<frame_window_to_client()> in C<X11::Protocol::WM>.

C<KeyPress> events are not used and go to the focus window in the usual way.
This can be good in a command line program since it lets the user press
C<^C> (C<SIGINT>) in an C<xterm> or similar.  Perhaps in the future there
could be an option to watch for C<Esc> to cancel or some such.

A virtual root per C<root_to_virtual_root()> in C<X11::Protocol::WM> is used
if present.  This helps C<ChooseWindow> work with C<amiwm> and similar
virtual root window managers.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following C<choose()> is in class method style with the intention of
perhaps in the future having objects of type C<X11::Protocol::ChooseWindow>
holding state and advanced by events supplied by an external main loop.

=head2 Choosing

=over 4

=item C<$window = X11::Protocol::ChooseWindow-E<gt>choose (key=E<gt>value,...)>

Read a user button press to choose a toplevel window.  The key/value options
are as follows,

    X        => X11::Protocol object
    display  => string ":0:0" etc

    screen   => integer, eg. 0
    root     => XID of root window

    time     => integer server timestamp
    event    => hashref of event initiating the choose

    cursor       => XID of cursor
    cursor_glyph => integer glyph for cursor font
    cursor_name  => string name from cursor font

C<X> or C<display> gives the server, or the default is to open the
C<DISPLAY> environment variable.  C<X> for an C<X11::Protocol> object is
usual, but sometimes it can make sense to open a new connection just to
choose.

C<root> or C<screen> gives the root window to choose on, or the default is
the current screen of C<$X>, which in turn defaults to the screen part of
the display name.  If there's a window manager virtual root then that's
automatically used as necessary.

C<time> or the time field in C<event> is a server timestamp for the
C<GrabPointer()>.  This guards against stealing a grab from another client
if badly lagged.  Omitted or C<undef> means C<CurrentTime>.  In a command
line program there might be no initiating event, making C<CurrentTime> all
that's possible.

C<cursor> etc is the mouse pointer cursor to show during the choose, as a
visual indication to the user.  The default is a "crosshair".
C<cursor_name> or C<cursor_glyph> are from the usual cursor font.  See
L<X11::CursorFont> for available names.  For example perhaps the "exchange"
cursor to choose a window for some sort of swap or flip,

    $window = X11::Protocol::ChooseWindow->choose
                (X => $X,
                 cursor_name => "exchange");
