# Window Manager Notes:
#
# ctwm does it's workspaces by moving windows or unmapping or something.
# There's no virtual root but it does draw the root window to a
# per-workspace colour on each change which overwrites anything put there in
# xsetroot style.
#
# evilwm desktop workspaces done by hiding/mapping windows.
#
# tvtwm comes with an ssetroot which looks at __SWM_VROOT.
#
# awesome does desktops by hiding/mapping and a task bar across the top.


# Maybe:

# Maybe read /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/gray like xsetroot -grey.
# Or /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/root_weave which is the server default.

=head1 NAME

X11::Protocol::XSetRoot -- set root window background

=for test_synopsis my ($X, $pixmap_xid)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use X11::Protocol::XSetRoot;
 X11::Protocol::XSetRoot->set_background (color => 'green');

 # or given $X, but which then can't be used any more
 X11::Protocol::XSetRoot->set_background
                  (X       => $X,
                   pixmap  => $pixmap_xid,
                   pixmap_allocated_colors => 1);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module sets the X root window background in the style of the
C<xsetroot> program.

The simplest use is a named colour interpreted by the server's usual
C<AllocNamedColor()> or a 1 to 4 digit hex string like "#RRGGBB" or
"#RRRRGGGGBBBB".

    X11::Protocol::XSetRoot->set_background
                               (color => 'green');

    X11::Protocol::XSetRoot->set_background
                               (color => '#FF0000'); # red

A pattern can be set with a pixmap.  A pixmap the size of the screen can
give a full background picture.

    # draw $pixmap with say $X->black_pixel and $X->white_pixel,
    # then set it with
    X11::Protocol::XSetRoot->set_background
                               (X      => $X,
                                pixmap => $pixmap);

C<set_background()> takes ownership of the given C<$pixmap> and frees it
with C<FreePixmap()> once put into the window background.

Setting the root to a pixmap drawn by a program is the main use for this
module.  If you just want a solid colour then that can be done easily enough
with the actual C<xsetroot> program.

=head2 Retained Resources

Allocated pixel colours and any C<use_esetroot> preserve pixels and pixmap
with C<SetCloseDownMode('RetainPermanent')> and leave root window properties
C<_XSETROOT_ID> or C<ESETROOT_PMAP_ID> ready to released by C<KillClient()>
at a future background change.

In these cases the C<$X> connection cannot be used any more since a further
background change and consequent C<KillClient()> could occur at any time,
perhaps immediately.

If a C<pixmap> is given then if it contains any allocated pixels
(C<AllocColor()> etc) then this should be indicated with the
C<pixmap_allocated_colors> option.  (Allocated pixels are noticed
automatically for C<pixel> and C<color> options.)

    # AllocColor colours, draw $pixmap with them, then
    #
    X11::Protocol::XSetRoot->set_background
                               (X      => $X,
                                pixmap => $pixmap,
                                pixmap_allocated_colors => 1);
    # don't use $X any more

The easiest thing is to close an C<$X> connection immediately after a
C<set_background()>.  Perhaps there could be a return value to say whether a
retain was done and so the connection cannot be used again.  Or perhaps if
in the future C<X11::Protocol> had an explicit C<$X-E<gt>close()> then that
could be done here so a closed connection would indicate it cannot be used
further.

If the root visual is static such as C<TrueColor> then there's no colour
allocation as such (C<AllocColor()> is just a lookup).  In this case
C<set_background()> knows there's no need for C<RetainPermanent> for
colours, only for pixmaps.

If the C<color> or C<pixel> options are the screen C<black_pixel> or
C<white_pixel> then those pixels exist permanently in the root colormap and
C<set_background()> knows there's no need for C<RetainPermanent>.  Similarly
if the server has the TOG-CUP extension (see L<X11::Protocol::Ext::TOG_CUP>)
then any reserved pixels listed there are recognised as permanent.

=head1 Virtual Root

C<XSetRoot> looks for C<__SWM_VROOT> using L<X11::Protocol::WM>
C<root_to_virtual_root()> and acts on that when applicable.  Such a virtual
root is used by C<amiwm>, C<swm> and C<tvtwm> window managers and the
C<xscreensaver> program.

Alas the enlightenment window manager uses a background window covering the
root window.  This stops most root window programs from working, including
XSetRoot here.

=head1 Esetroot

The C<Esetroot> program and various compatible programs such as C<fvwm-root>
use different properties than C<xsetroot>.  The C<Esetroot> method records
the root pixmap ready for use by programs such as C<Eterm>, for example to
implement pseudo-transparency (C<Eterm --trans>, which is what the method
was designed for).

The C<set_background()> option C<use_esetroot> uses the C<Esetroot> style
rather than the default C<xsetroot> style.  If this is given with C<pixel>
or C<color> options then C<set_background()> makes a 1x1 pixmap to give a
solid colour.

C<set_background()> always deletes and kills (as appropriate) both the
C<xsetroot> and C<Esetroot> properties since both are superseded by a new
background.

For reference, to use C<Eterm --trans> (as of its version 0.9.6 March 2011)
an C<Esetroot> background should be present at C<Eterm> startup and should
not be removed later (or set to "None").  It doesn't notice a later
C<Esetroot> or re-install.  In practice this means C<Esetroot> before
running C<Eterm> and then all future background changes in C<Esetroot>
style.

The advantage of the C<Esetroot> method is that the root pixmap is available
for client programs to use in creative ways.  If the client draws some of
the root pixmap as its own background then it can appear semi-transparent
without the SHAPE extension, and perhaps do some visual effects like shading
or dithering.

For comparison the C<xsetroot> style means the root pixmap is not available
to client programs and therefore in principle allows the server to apply it
to the hardware and never refer to it again.  In practice that might not
occur, if for example on multiple console "virtual terminals" the server
must give up the hardware when switched away.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<X11::Protocol::XSetRoot-E<gt>set_background (key=E<gt>value, ...)>

Set the root window background to a pixmap or colour.  The key/value
parameters are

    X        => X11::Protocol object
    display  => string ":0.0" etc

    screen   => integer, eg. 0
    root     => XID of root window

    color    => string
    pixel    => integer pixel value
    pixmap   => XID of pixmap to display, or "None"
    pixmap_allocated_colors => boolean, default false
    use_esetroot => boolean, default false

The server is given by an C<X> connection object, or a C<display> name to
connect to, or the default is the C<DISPLAY> environment variable.

The root window is given by C<root> or C<screen>, or the default is the
default screen in C<$X> either per C<$X-E<gt>choose_screen()> or the default
from the display name.

The background to show is given by a colour name, pixel value, or pixmap.
C<color> can be anything understood by the server C<AllocNamedColor()>, plus
1 to 4 digit hex

    blue              named colours
    #RGB              hex digits
    #RRGGBB
    #RRRGGGBBB
    #RRRRGGGGBBBB

C<pixel> is an integer pixel value in the root window colormap.  It's
automatically recognised as allocated or not (the screen pre-defined black
or white and TOG-CUP reserved pixels are permanent and so reckoned not
allocated).

C<pixmap> is an XID integer.  C<set_background()> takes ownership of this
pixmap and will C<FreePixmap()> once installed.  "None" or 0 means no
pixmap, which gives the server's default root background (usually a black
and white weave pattern).

C<pixmap_allocated_colors> should be true if any of the pixels in C<pixmap>
were allocated with C<AllocColor()> etc, as opposed to just the screen
pre-defined black and white pixels (and any TOG-CUP permanent pixels).

C<use_esetroot> means use the root window properties in the style of
C<Esetroot>.  This allows programs such as C<Eterm> to use the root
background for "pseudo-transparency" or in other creative ways.

When an allocated pixel or a pixmap with allocated pixels is set as the
background the C<_XSETROOT_ID> mechanism described above means the C<$X>
connection could be killed by another C<xsetroot> at any time, perhaps
immediately, and for that reason C<$X> should not be used any more.  The
easiest way is to make C<set_background()> the last thing done on C<$X>.

Setting an allocated C<pixel> or any C<pixmap> can only be done on a C<$X>
connection as such, not with the C<display> option.  This is because
retaining the colours with the C<_XSETROOT_ID> mechanism can only be done
from the client connection which created the resources, not a new separate
client connection.

=head1 ROOT WINDOW PROPERTIES

=over

=item C<_XSETROOT_ID>

For C<xsetroot>, if colours in the root window background are allocated by
C<AllocColor()> etc then C<_XSETROOT_ID> is a pixmap XID which can be killed
by C<KillClient()> to free those colours when the root background is
replaced.  C<_XSETROOT_ID> is only a 1x1 dummy pixmap, it's not the actual
root background pixmap.

=item C<_XROOTPMAP_ID>

For C<Esetroot> style, this is the current root window background pixmap.
It might be set by an C<Esetroot> which has run and exited, or it might be
set by a window manager or similar which is still running.

Client programs can use this to combine the root background into their own
window in interesting ways.  Listen to C<PropertyNotify> on the root window
for background changes.  Note that since this pixmap belongs to another
client it could be freed at any time, so protocol errors when copying or
drawing from it should generally be ignored, or cause a fallback to some
default.

=item C<ESETROOT_PMAP_ID>

For C<Esetroot> style, this is the same as C<_XROOTPMAP_ID> if that pixmap
was created by C<Esetroot> and saved by
C<SetCloseDownMode('RetainPermanent')>.  This should be freed by
C<KillClient()> if the background is replaced.

The specification L<http://www.eterm.org/docs/view.php?doc=ref#trans>
advises killing C<ESETROOT_PMAP_ID> only when equal to C<_XROOTPMAP_ID>.
Probably it's safer to always kill C<ESETROOT_PMAP_ID> if replacing its
value, to be sure of not leaking resources.  But perhaps if both
C<ESETROOT_PMAP_ID> and C<_XROOTPMAP_ID> exist then they are always equal.
