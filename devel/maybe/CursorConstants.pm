=head1 NAME

X11::CursorConstants - cursor font glyph constants

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use X11::CursorConstants;
 my $glyphnum = X11::CursorConstants::crosshair; # is 34

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the glyphs of the X11 "cursor" font as Perl constant subrs.  The
cursor font is the usual way to create mouse pointer cursors of various
standard shapes.

The subr names are per the Xlib F</usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h>, without
the C<XC_> prefixes.  Each glyph is a character for the foreground shape,
and the next character is the background mask.

    X11::CursorConstants::fleur,       # glyph
    X11::CursorConstants::fleur + 1,   # and its mask

So for example to create a "crosshair" cursor,

    my $cursor_font = $X->new_rsrc;
    $X->OpenConstants ($cursor_font, "cursor");

    my $cursor = $X->new_rsrc;
    $X->CreateGlyphCursor
          ($cursor,
           $cursor_font,  # font
           $cursor_font,  # mask font
           X11::CursorConstants::crosshair,      # glyph
           X11::CursorConstants::crosshair + 1,  # and its mask
           0,0,0,                  # foreground, black
           0xFFFF,0xFFFF,0xFFFF);  # background, white

The images can be viewed with the C<xfd> font display program,

     xfd -fn cursor

=head1 CONSTANTS

There's no exporting, since it's unlikely more than a handful will be
needed, and usually only in one or two places each.  The full list is
